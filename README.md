Patient Recording System created using SQL

The aim of this assessment was to create the system using Oracle SQL to keep a record of the patients, staffs and appointments.
Different types of entities, attributes, constraints, and keys were created whilst creating this system.
Normalization of the developed database was done from UNF to 3NF.
The whole process in development of this system is written in the report file where the ER and Relational diagram is also drawn.
